          <p>Wombats, by their Aboriginal name, look like small, short-legged, broad-headed, brown bear cubs measuring about 1.20m long by 70cm tall. The coat color of wombats can be tan, brown, black or gray.</p>

          <p>Like all marsupials, they have a ventral pouch, which in the wombat has only one pair of teats. His pocket opens to the back, so dirt doesn't get in there when he digs.</p>

          <p>The wombat has a “shield”: a very hard cartilaginous plate located under the skin of its hindquarters. When a predator pursues it, it can block the entrance to its burrow with this shield before counter-attacking with violent kicks of its strong hind legs.</p>

        <article>
          <p> This document assumes you have the following basic knowledge</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials of the family Vombatidae that are native to Australia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Living species are about 1 m (40 in) in length with small, stubby tails and weigh between 20 and 35 kg (44 and 77 lb).
            </li>
            <li>
              They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of southern and eastern Australia.

          <h1>Diet</h1>
          <p>The wombat is herbivorous, feeding on grass, roots, fungi and tree bark. Its teeth grow continuously, unlike other marsupials. It has a slow metabolism, with complete digestion of its food taking place in two weeks, which helps it survive in arid environments.</p>

          <p>The wombat has the particularity of producing more or less cubic droppings, which it piles up to mark its territory. On November 18, 2018, at the 71st Annual Meeting of the Division of Fluid Dynamics of the American Physical Society, Patricia Yang (who received an Ig-Nobel Prize in 2015 for demonstrating that the duration of urination does not vary not with body size) reveals that the intestine of the wombat is not uniformly elastic but has less flexible sections, more tight in its last section, where the liquid stools are transformed into solid "cubes" 4 cm long. She says: “We found that the pressure of the intestinal walls varies from 20% at the corners of the cube to 75% at its edges”. The intestinal walls exerting different physical constraints according to the places thus allow the wombat to produce such characteristic faeces, easier to pile up than round droppings.</p>

          <code>This peculiarity had not been detected before, because wombats had until then only been studied in captivity, and they only exhibit this behavior in freedom.</code>

          <h1>Reproduction</h1>
          <p>The wombat is a rather solitary animal and only socializes during the breeding season in order to find a partner. The female has a gestation period of 20–30 days15,16 and will only give birth to one calf, or in very rare cases two. At birth, the baby wombat, called a "joey", measures only three centimeters and weighs only about two grams. It will remain in its mother's pouch for 5 to 9 months before opening up to the outside world. During this period, he feeds only on his mother's milk. The young are weaned after 15 months, and sexually mature at the age of 18 months8. Generally, females stay with their mother longer than males.</p>

          <h1>Behavior</h1>
          <p>Wombats occupy territories centered on their burrows and which they defend against intruders; in the common wombat, this territory can cover up to 23 hectares, when it is only 4 hectares in the other two species8. Threatened, it can reach the speed of 40 km/h and maintain it for 90 seconds.</p>

          <p>The wombat is not shy and, its running endurance being reduced, it prefers to defend on the spot to flight. On the edge of the Australian roads, while stopping, one can sometimes approach some of them. However, their lack of fear can lead them to acts of aggression if they feel threatened, or even just in a bad mood. Their weight allows them to knock down a human of average build and their powerful jaws can lead to serious injuries: naturalist Harry Frauca was bitten to a depth of 2 cm in the leg through a rubber boot, a trouser leg and a thick woolen sock.</p>

          <p>They are found in many parks, zoos and other tourist sites across Australia where they are very popular. There are even examples of domestication: if properly cuddled and petted, wombats become friendly, however as they age they tend to become grumpy.</p>

          <p>Once hunted by Australian Aborigines for food, then by white settlers for their thick fur, wombats are still hunted by some farmers, but it's mostly vehicles that kill dozens of them on the side of roads every day. . In addition, herds of sheep and cattle deplete the diet of wombats.</p>

          <p>Reserves to protect them have been created.</p>

          <p>An asteroid, (6827) Wombat, was named in reference to these animals.</p>
